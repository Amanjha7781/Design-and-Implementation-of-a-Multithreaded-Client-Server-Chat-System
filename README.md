 Chat-On  : A Python Based Chat Room

This is a basic yet robust **Python-based Chat Room** project. It is implemented through **Socket Programming** in Python. A server is operated on a defined IP Address and Port, and several clients may connect to it. After connecting, each user is prompted to input a nickname, and then all the messages are broadcasted to the group in real time.

  Introduction

 What are Sockets?
Sockets are employed for communication between various computers over a network. We can send and receive messages with the assistance of socket APIs. In this project, sockets are employed to enable several users to chat with one another within a single chat room.

TCP Socket
The chat system is implemented employing **TCP sockets**, which ensure that all the messages will be delivered reliably from one client to another through the server.

âš¡ Usage

1. Initialize the server with:
   ```bash
   python Server.py
Ensure you verify and modify the IP address and Port number within the script if necessary. It defaults to localhost:5555.

Initialize the client by running:

bash
Copy code
python Client.py
Input your nickname, and you are now ready to chat with other people in the room.

 Features (v1.2)
Admin controls implemented for enhanced management:

Kick: Admin can kick a user out of the chat room.

Ban: Admin can ban a user permanently from joining again.

Minor bug fixes and stability enhancements.

 Demo

What I Learned
From working on this project, I learned:

How socket programming is done using Python.

Server-side and client-side program difference.

Basics of real-time communication between multiple systems.

How admin functionality such as kick/ban can be done.

Future Improvements
Some things I would like to implement in the future:

Adding a basic GUI interface instead of command line.

Implementing encrypted chat for greater security.

Adding functions like private messaging.
